; We can model electrical circuits using streams to represent the values of
; currents or voltages at a sequence of times. For instance, suppose we have
; an RC circuit consisting of a resistor of resistance R and a capacitor C in
; series. The voltage response v of the circuit to an injected current i is
; determined by the formula in figure 3.33, whose structure is shown by the
; accomplanying signal-flow diagram:
;
;   [figure 3.33]
;
; Write a procedure RC that models this circuit. RC should take as inputs the
; values of R, C, and dt and should return a procedure that takes as inputs a
; stream representing the current i and an initial value for the capacitor
; voltage vâ‚€ and produces as output the stream of voltages v. For example, you
; should be able to use RC to model an RC circuit with R = 5 ohms, C = 1
; farad, and 0.5-second time step by evaluating (define RC1 (RC 5 1 0.5)).
; This defines RC1 as a procedure that takes a stream representing the time
; sequence of currents and an initial capacitor voltage and produces the
; output stream of voltages.

; Man, this brings me a long time back. Also, I have no idea what I'm doing.
