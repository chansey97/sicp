; The procedure for-each is similar to map. It takes as arguments a procedure
; and a list of elements. However, rather than forming a list of the results,
; for-each just applies the procedure to each of the elements in turn, from
; left to right. The values returned by applying the procedure to the elements
; are not used at all - for-each is used with procedures that perform an action
; such as printing. For example,
;
; (for-each (lambda (x) (newline) (display x))
;           (list 57 321 88))
;
; The value returned by the call to for-each (not illustrated above) can be
; something arbitrary, such as true. Give an implementation of for-each.
